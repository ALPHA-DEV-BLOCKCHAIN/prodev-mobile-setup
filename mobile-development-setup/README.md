# Mobile Development Environment Setup

## Objective
This document records my process of setting up a mobile development environment using Expo for React Native. The goal is to be able to run and test React Native applications directly on a physical device using the Expo Go app.

---

## Prerequisites
- Node.js LTS installed
- Visual Studio Code installed
- macOS, Linux, or Windows operating system
- Expo Go installed on an Android or iOS device

---

## Setup Process

1. **Verified Node.js installation**
Node.js was already installed on my system.

2. **Opened the project folder in VS Code**

3. **Installed Expo Go on my phone**
- Visited [https://expo.dev/go](https://expo.dev/go)
- Installed from the Google Play Store (Android)
- Opened the app and signed in with an Expo account

4. **Created a test Expo project**
This launched the Expo development server and displayed a QR code in the terminal.

5. **Tested the app on my phone**
- Opened the Expo Go app
- Scanned the QR code
- The default “Welcome to Expo” screen appeared, confirming a successful setup

---

## Challenges Faced
- Faced some network issues when Expo Go couldn’t connect to the development server. Solved it by connecting both my phone and laptop to the same Wi-Fi network.
- Had to reinstall Node.js to fix npm path issues.
- The initial QR code scan failed once; restarting the Expo server fixed it.

---

## Outcome
Expo was successfully set up, and I can now run and test React Native applications directly on my physical device using Expo Go.
